# WASM.CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)
## Version : 1.0.0

WASM.CDT is a toolchain for WebAssembly (WASM) and set of tools to facilitate contract writing for the WASM platform.  In addition to being a general purpose WebAssembly toolchain, WASM.cdt specific optimizations are available to support building WASM smart contracts.  This new toolchain is built around Clang 7, which means that WASM.CDT has the most currently available optimizations and analyses from LLVM, but as the WASM target is still considered experimental, some optimizations are not available or incomplete.


### Binary Releases
WASM.CDT currently supports Mac OS X brew, Linux x86_64 Debian packages, and Linux x86_64 RPM packages.
